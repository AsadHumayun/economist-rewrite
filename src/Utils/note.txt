Comment on this in your coursework:

- ESM circular dependencies; you cannot import export modules that do that to each other, known as a circular module dependency. It messes with the ESM interpreter. 
I encoutnered this issue when attempting to import default PET_EMOJIS from ./Constants.js into ./petaliases.js ---- this just didn't work, kept causing the following error: 

ReferenceError: Cannot access 'Constants' before initialization
    at file:///C:/Users/U/Documents/GitHub/economist-rewrite/Utils/Functions.js:8:24
    at ModuleJob.run (node:internal/modules/esm/module_job:195:25)
    at async Promise.all (index 0)
    at async ESMLoader.import (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:337:24)
    at async loadESM (node:internal/process/esm_loader:88:5)
   
Which makes sense, as all of these files in this directory are intertwined and all converge upon one file.
This was resolved by just moving the default pet emojis string[] into petaliases.js - tbh it made more sense for it to be there anyway lol
On the plus side, didn't lose any sort of functionality because client.const.PET_EMOJIS was never accessed anywhere in my code so was pretty much redundant anyway.
